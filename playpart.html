    <p class="speech nora">
      Someone is coming now! No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
      Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—
    </p>
    <p class="direction">_[opens the door and looks out]_</p>
    <p class="speech nora">No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty.</p>
    <p class="direction">_[Comes forward.]_</p>
    <p class="speech nora">
      What rubbish! of course he can't be in earnes \t about it. Such a thing
      couldnt happen; it is impossible—I have three little children.
    </p>
    <p class="direction">
      _[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
      box.]_
    </p>

    <h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
    <p class="speech nurse">
      At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">Thanks; put it on the table.</p>

    <h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
    <p class="direction">_[doing so]_.</p>
    <p class="speech nurse">But it is very much in want of mending.</p>

    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">
      I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
    <p class="speech nurse">
      What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">
      Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name nurse">NURSE.</h4>
    <p class="speech nurse">
      What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma'am, and
      make yourself ill.
    </p>
    <p class="direction">
      _[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and
      hat.]_
    </p>
    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">
      Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could help
      me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening
      there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborg's, who live above us;
      and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the
      Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
    </p>
    <h4 class="name linde">MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p class="speech linde">I see; you are going to keep up the character</p>
    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">
      Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it made for
      me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any idea—
    </p>
    <h4 class="name linde">MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p class="speech linde">
      We will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming come unsewn
      here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's all we want.
    </p>
    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">It is nice of you.</p>
    <h4 class="name linde">MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p class="direction">_[sewing]_.</p>
    <p class="speech linde">
      So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what—I
      shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have
      completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.
    </p>
    <h4 class="name linde">MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p class="speech linde">
      And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father's daughter for
      nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as he was
      yesterday?
    </p>
    <h4 class="name nora">NORA.</h4>
    <p class="speech nora">
      No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers from
      a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine, poor creature.
      His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses; and
      that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you understand?
