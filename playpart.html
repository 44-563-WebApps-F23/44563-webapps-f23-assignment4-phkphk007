      _[THE SAME SCENE.—THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
      stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
      dishevelled branches. NORA’S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She is
      alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and takes
      up her cloak.]_ NORA. _[drops her cloak]_. Someone is coming now! _[Goes
      to the door and listens.]_ No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come
      today, Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—_[opens the door
      and looks out]_. No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes
      forward.]_ What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it. Such a
      thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little children.
      _[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
      box.]_ NURSE. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress. NORA.
      Thanks; put it on the table. NURSE. _[doing so]_. But it is very much in
      want of mending. NORA. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand
      pieces. NURSE. What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little
      patience. NORA. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with
      it. NURSE. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
      ma’am, and make yourself ill. NORA. Well, worse than that might happen.
      How are the children? NURSE. The poor little souls are playing with their
      Christmas presents, but— NORA. Do they ask much for me? NURSE. You see,
      they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them. NORA. Yes, but,
      nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I was before.
      NURSE. Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything. NORA. Do
      you think so? Do you think they would forget their mother if she went away
      altogether? NURSE. Good heavens!—went away altogether? NORA. Nurse, I want
      you to tell me something I have often wondered about—how could you have
      the heart to put your own child out among strangers? NURSE. I was obliged
      to, if I wanted to be little Nora’s nurse. NORA. Yes, but how could you be
      willing to do it? NURSE. What, when I was going to get such a good place
      by it? A poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to. Besides,
      that wicked man didn’t do a single thing for me. NORA. But I suppose your
      daughter has quite forgotten you. NURSE. No, indeed she hasn’t. She wrote
      to me when she was confirmed, and when she was married. NORA. _[putting
      her arms round her neck]_. Dear old Anne, you were a good mother to me
      when I was little. NURSE. Little Nora, poor dear, had no other mother but
      me. NORA. And if my little ones had no other mother, I am sure you
      would—What nonsense I am talking! _[Opens the box.]_ Go in to them. Now I
      must—. You will see tomorrow how charming I shall look. NURSE. I am sure
      there will be no one at the ball so charming as you, ma’am. _[Goes into
      the room on the left.]_ NORA. _[begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes
      it away from her]_. If only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If
      only I could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and
      nonsense! No one will come. Only I mustn’t think about it. I will brush my
      muff. What lovely, lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts!
      One, two, three, four, five, six— _[Screams.]_ Ah! there is someone
      coming—. _[Makes a movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.]_
      _[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and
      hat.]_ NORA. Oh, it’s you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is
      there? How good of you to come! MRS LINDE. I heard you were up asking for
      me. NORA. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you
      could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow
      evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs’, who live
      above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and
      dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri. MRS LINDE. I see; you are
      going to keep up the character. NORA. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here
      is the dress; Torvald had it made for me there, but now it is all so torn,
      and I haven’t any idea— MRS LINDE. We will easily put that right. It is
      only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread?
      Now then, that’s all we want. NORA. It is nice of you. MRS LINDE.
      _[sewing]_. So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell
      you what—I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers.
      But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening
      yesterday. NORA. _[gets up, and crosses the stage]_. Well, I don’t think
      yesterday was as pleasant as usual. You ought to have come to town a
      little earlier, Christine. Certainly Torvald does understand how to make a
      house dainty and attractive. MRS LINDE. And so do you, it seems to me; you
      are not your father’s daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank
      always as depressed as he was yesterday? NORA. No; yesterday it was very
      noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease.
      He has consumption of the spine, poor creature. His father was a horrible
      man who committed all sorts of excesses; and that is why his son was
      sickly from childhood, do you understand? MRS LINDE. _[dropping her
      sewing]_. But, my dearest Nora, how do you know anything about such
      things? NORA. _[walking about]_. Pooh! When you have three children, you
      get visits now and then from—from married women, who know something of
      medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another. MRS LINDE.
      _[goes on sewing. A short silence]_. Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?
      NORA. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald’s most intimate friend, and a
      great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family. MRS LINDE.
      But tell me this—is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn’t he the kind of man
      that is very anxious to make himself agreeable? NORA. Not in the least.
      What makes you think that? MRS LINDE. When you introduced him to me
      yesterday, he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house;
      but afterwards I noticed that your husband hadn’t the slightest idea who I
      was. So how could Doctor Rank—? NORA. That is quite right, Christine.
      Torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself,
      as he says. At first he used to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of
      the dear folk at home, so naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk
      about such things with Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.
      MRS LINDE. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many
      things, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more
      experience. Let me tell you this—you ought to make an end of it with
      Doctor Rank. NORA. What ought I to make an end of? MRS LINDE. Of two
      things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich admirer
      who was to leave you money— NORA. An admirer who doesn’t exist,
      unfortunately! But what then? MRS LINDE. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?
      NORA. Yes, he is. MRS LINDE. And has no one to provide for? NORA. No, no
      one; but— MRS LINDE. And comes here everyday? NORA. Yes, I told you so.
      MRS LINDE. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless? NORA. I don’t
      understand you at all. MRS LINDE. Don’t prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose
      I don’t guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds? NORA. Are you
      out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A friend of ours,
      who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly painful position
      that would be? MRS LINDE. Then it really isn’t he? NORA. No, certainly
      not. It would never have entered into my head for a moment. Besides, he
      had no money to lend then; he came into his money afterwards. MRS LINDE.
      Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora. NORA. No, it would
      never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank. Although I am quite sure
      that if I had asked him— MRS LINDE. But of course you won’t. NORA. Of
      course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be necessary. But
      I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank— MRS LINDE. Behind your
      husband’s back? NORA. I must make an end of it with the other one, and
      that will be behind his back too. I must make an end of it with him. MRS
      LINDE. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but— NORA. _[walking up and
      down]_. A man can put a thing like that straight much easier than a woman—
      MRS LINDE. One’s husband, yes. NORA. Nonsense! _[Standing still.]_ When
      you pay off a debt you get your bond back, don’t you? MRS LINDE. Yes, as a
      matter of course. NORA. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces,
      and burn it up—the nasty dirty paper! MRS LINDE. _[looks hard at her, lays
      down her sewing and gets up slowly]_. Nora, you are concealing something
      from me. NORA. Do I look as if I were? MRS LINDE. Something has happened
      to you since yesterday morning. Nora, what is it? NORA. _[going nearer to
      her]_. Christine! _[Listens.]_ Hush! there’s Torvald come home. Do you
      mind going in to the children for the present? Torvald can’t bear to see
      dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you. MRS LINDE. _[gathering some of
      the things together]_. Certainly—but I am not going away from here until
      we have had it out with one another. _[She goes into the room on the left,
      as HELMER comes in from the hall.]_ NORA. _[going up to HELMER]_. I have
      wanted you so much, Torvald dear. HELMER. Was that the dressmaker? NORA.
      No, it was Christine; she is helping me to put my dress in order. You will
      see I shall look quite smart. HELMER. Wasn’t that a happy thought of mine,
      now? NORA. Splendid! But don’t you think it is nice of me, too, to do as
      you wish? HELMER. Nice?—because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well,
      you little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am not
      going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I expect.
      NORA. I suppose you are going to work. HELMER. Yes. _[Shows her a bundle
      of papers.]_ Look at that. I have just been into the bank. _[Turns to go
      into his room.]_ NORA. Torvald. HELMER. Yes. NORA. If your little squirrel
      were to ask you for something very, very prettily—? HELMER. What then?
      NORA. Would you do it? HELMER. I should like to hear what it is, first.
      NORA. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would be
      nice, and do what she wants. HELMER. Speak plainly. NORA. Your skylark
      would chirp about in every room, with her song rising and falling— HELMER.
      Well, my skylark does that anyhow. NORA. I would play the fairy and dance
      for you in the moonlight, Torvald. HELMER. Nora—you surely don’t mean that
      request you made to me this morning? NORA. _[going near him]_. Yes,
      Torvald, I beg you so earnestly— HELMER. Have you really the courage to
      open up that question again? NORA. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you
      must let Krogstad keep his post in the bank. HELMER. My dear Nora, it is
      his post that I have arranged Mrs Linde shall have. NORA. Yes, you have
      been awfully kind about that; but you could just as well dismiss some
      other clerk instead of Krogstad. HELMER. This is simply incredible
      obstinacy! Because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you
      would speak for him, I am expected to— NORA. That isn’t the reason,
      Torvald. It is for your own sake. This fellow writes in the most
      scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so yourself. He can do you an
      unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened to death of him— HELMER. Ah, I
      understand; it is recollections of the past that scare you. NORA. What do
      you mean? HELMER. Naturally you are thinking of your father. NORA.
      Yes—yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious
      creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they slandered
      him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the Department
      had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not been so
      kindly disposed and helpful to him. HELMER. My little Nora, there is an
      important difference between your father and me. Your father’s reputation
      as a public official was not above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will
      continue to be so, as long as I hold my office. NORA. You never can tell
      what mischief these men may contrive. We ought to be so well off, so snug
      and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no cares—you and I and the
      children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly— HELMER. And it is
      just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep
      him. It is already known at the Bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is
      it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his
      wife’s bidding— NORA. And what if it did? HELMER. Of course!—if only this
      obstinate little person can get her way! Do you suppose I am going to make
      myself ridiculous before my whole staff, to let people think that I am a
      man to be swayed by all sorts of outside influence? I should very soon
      feel the consequences of it, I can tell you! And besides, there is one
      thing that makes it quite impossible for me to have Krogstad in the Bank
      as long as I am manager. NORA. Whatever is that? HELMER. His moral
      failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary— NORA. Yes, you
      could—couldn’t you? HELMER. And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I
      knew him when we were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so
      often prove an incubus in afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we
      were once on very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless
      fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present. On the
      contrary, he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with
      me, and every minute it is “I say, Helmer, old fellow!” and that sort of
      thing. I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my
      position in the Bank intolerable. NORA. Torvald, I don’t believe you mean
      that. HELMER. Don’t you? Why not? NORA. Because it is such a narrow-minded
      way of looking at things. HELMER. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do
      you think I am narrow-minded? NORA. No, just the opposite, dear—and it is
      exactly for that reason. HELMER. It’s the same thing. You say my point of
      view is narrow-minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well—I
      must put an end to this. _[Goes to the hall door and calls.]_ Helen! NORA.
      What are you going to do? HELMER. _[looking among his papers]_. Settle it.
      _[Enter MAID.]_ Look here; take this letter and go downstairs with it at
      once. Find a messenger and tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The
      address is on it, and here is the money. MAID. Very well, sir. _[Exit with
      the letter.]_ HELMER. _[putting his papers together]_. Now then, little
      Miss Obstinate. NORA. _[breathlessly]_. Torvald—what was that letter?
      HELMER. Krogstad’s dismissal. NORA. Call her back, Torvald! There is still
      time. Oh Torvald, call her back! Do it for my sake—for your own sake—for
      the children’s sake! Do you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don’t
      know what that letter can bring upon us. HELMER. It’s too late. NORA. Yes,
      it’s too late. HELMER. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in,
      although really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn’t it an insult
      to think that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver’s vengeance?
      But I forgive you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to
      your great love for me. _[Takes her in his arms.]_ And that is as it
      should be, my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall
      have both courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man
      enough to take everything upon myself. NORA. _[in a horror-stricken
      voice]_. What do you mean by that? HELMER. Everything, I say— NORA.
      _[recovering herself]_. You will never have to do that. HELMER. That’s
      right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife should. That is how
      it shall be. _[Caressing her.]_ Are you content now? There! There!—not
      these frightened dove’s eyes! The whole thing is only the wildest
      fancy!—Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and practise with
      your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut the door, and I
      shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you please. _[Turns back
      at the door.]_ And when Rank comes, tell him where he will find me. _[Nods
      to her, takes his papers and goes into his room, and shuts the door after
      him.]_ NORA. _[bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot,
      and whispers]_. He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it
      in spite of everything.—No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than
      that! Oh, for some help, some way out of it! _[The door-bell rings.]_
      Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that—anything, whatever it is! _[She
      puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door and
      opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the
      following dialogue it begins to grow dark.]_ NORA. Good day, Doctor Rank.
      I knew your ring. But you mustn’t go in to Torvald now; I think he is busy
      with something. RANK. And you? NORA. _[brings him in and shuts the door
      after him]_. Oh, you know very well I always have time for you. RANK.
      Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can. NORA. What do you
      mean by that? As much of it as you can? RANK. Well, does that alarm you?
      NORA. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to
      happen? RANK. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I
      certainly didn’t expect it to happen so soon. NORA. _[gripping him by the
      arm]_. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me. RANK.
      _[sitting down by the stove]_. It is all up with me. And it can’t be
      helped. NORA. _[with a sigh of relief]_. Is it about yourself? RANK. Who
      else? It is no use lying to one’s self. I am the most wretched of all my
      patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my internal
      economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting in the
      churchyard. NORA. What an ugly thing to say! RANK. The thing itself is
      cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much
      more that is ugly before that. I shall only make one more examination of
      myself; when I have done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will
      be that the horrors of dissolution will begin. There is something I want
      to tell you. Helmer’s refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at
      everything that is ugly; I won’t have him in my sick-room. NORA. Oh, but,
      Doctor Rank— RANK. I won’t have him there. Not on any account. I bar my
      door to him. As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I
      shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know
      that the loathsome end has begun. NORA. You are quite absurd today. And I
      wanted you so much to be in a really good humour. RANK. With death
      stalking beside me?—To have to pay this penalty for another man’s sin? Is
      there any justice in that? And in every single family, in one way or
      another, some such inexorable retribution is being exacted— NORA.
      _[putting her hands over her ears]_. Rubbish! Do talk of something
      cheerful. RANK. Oh, it’s a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor
      innocent spine has to suffer for my father’s youthful amusements. NORA.
      _[sitting at the table on the left]_. I suppose you mean that he was too
      partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don’t you? RANK. Yes, and to
      truffles. NORA. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose? RANK. Oysters,
      of course, that goes without saying. NORA. And heaps of port and
      champagne. It is sad that all these nice things should take their revenge
      on our bones. RANK. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the
      unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.
      NORA. Yes, that’s the saddest part of it all. RANK. _[with a searching
      look at her]_. Hm!— NORA. _[after a short pause]_. Why did you smile?
      RANK. No, it was you that laughed. NORA. No, it was you that smiled,
      Doctor Rank! RANK. _[rising]_. You are a greater rascal than I thought.
      NORA. I am in a silly mood today. RANK. So it seems. NORA. _[putting her
      hands on his shoulders]_. Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death mustn’t take you
      away from Torvald and me. RANK. It is a loss you would easily recover
      from. Those who are gone are soon forgotten. NORA. _[looking at him
      anxiously]_. Do you believe that? RANK. People form new ties, and then—
      NORA. Who will form new ties? RANK. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone.
      You yourself are already on the high road to it, I think. What did that
      Mrs Linde want here last night? NORA. Oho!—you don’t mean to say you are
      jealous of poor Christine? RANK. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in
      this house. When I am done for, this woman will— NORA. Hush! don’t speak
      so loud. She is in that room. RANK. Today again. There, you see. NORA. She
      has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how unreasonable you
      are! _[Sits down on the sofa.]_ Be nice now, Doctor Rank, and tomorrow you
      will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can imagine I am doing it
      all for you—and for Torvald too, of course. _[Takes various things out of
      the box.]_ Doctor Rank, come and sit down here, and I will show you
      something. RANK. _[sitting down]_. What is it? NORA. Just look at those!
      RANK. Silk stockings. NORA. Flesh-coloured. Aren’t they lovely? It is so
      dark here now, but tomorrow—. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet.
      Oh well, you may have leave to look at the legs too. RANK. Hm!— NORA. Why
      are you looking so critical? Don’t you think they will fit me? RANK. I
      have no means of forming an opinion about that. NORA. _[looks at him for a
      moment]_. For shame! _[Hits him lightly on the ear with the stockings.]_
      That’s to punish you. _[Folds them up again.]_ RANK. And what other nice
      things am I to be allowed to see? NORA. Not a single thing more, for being
      so naughty. _[She looks among the things, humming to herself.]_ RANK.
      _[after a short silence]_. When I am sitting here, talking to you as
      intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become
      of me if I had never come into this house. NORA. _[smiling]_. I believe
      you do feel thoroughly at home with us. RANK. _[in a lower voice, looking
      straight in front of him]_. And to be obliged to leave it all— NORA.
      Nonsense, you are not going to leave it. RANK. _[as before]_. And not be
      able to leave behind one the slightest token of one’s gratitude, scarcely
      even a fleeting regret—nothing but an empty place which the first comer
      can fill as well as any other. NORA. And if I asked you now for a—? No!
      RANK. For what? NORA. For a big proof of your friendship— RANK. Yes, yes!
      NORA. I mean a tremendously big favour— RANK. Would you really make me so
      happy for once? NORA. Ah, but you don’t know what it is yet. RANK. No—but
      tell me. NORA. I really can’t, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all
      reason; it means advice, and help, and a favour— RANK. The bigger a thing
      it is the better. I can’t conceive what it is you mean. Do tell me.
      Haven’t I your confidence? NORA. More than anyone else. I know you are my
      truest and best friend, and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor
      Rank, it is something you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly,
      how inexpressibly deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment
      hesitate to give his life for me. RANK. _[leaning towards her]_. Nora—do
      you think he is the only one—? NORA. _[with a slight start]_. The only
      one—? RANK. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.
      NORA. _[sadly]_. Is that it? RANK. I was determined you should know it
      before I went away, and there will never be a better opportunity than
      this. Now you know it, Nora. And now you know, too, that you can trust me
      as you would trust no one else. NORA. _[rises, deliberately and quietly]_.
      Let me pass. RANK. _[makes room for her to pass him, but sits still]_.
      Nora! NORA. _[at the hall door]_. Helen, bring in the lamp. _[Goes over to
      the stove.]_ Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you. RANK. To
      have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid? NORA. No, but
      to go and tell me so. There was really no need— RANK. What do you mean?
      Did you know—? _[MAID enters with lamp, puts it down on the table, and
      goes out.]_ Nora—Mrs Helmer—tell me, had you any idea of this? NORA. Oh,
      how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn’t? I really can’t tell
      you—To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were getting on so
      nicely. RANK. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me,
      body and soul. So won’t you speak out? NORA. _[looking at him]_. After
      what happened? RANK. I beg you to let me know what it is. NORA. I can’t
      tell you anything now. RANK. Yes, yes. You mustn’t punish me in that way.
      Let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do. NORA. You can
      do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don’t need any help at all. You
      will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is
      so—of course it is! _[Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him
      with a smile.]_ You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!—don’t you feel
      ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come? RANK. Not a bit. But perhaps I
      had better go—for ever? NORA. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you
      must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can’t do without
      you. RANK. Yes, but you? NORA. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when
      you come. RANK. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a
      riddle to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my
      company as in Helmer’s. NORA. Yes—you see there are some people one loves
      best, and others whom one would almost always rather have as companions.
      RANK. Yes, there is something in that. NORA. When I was at home, of course
      I loved papa best. But I always thought it tremendous fun if I could steal
      down into the maids’ room, because they never moralised at all, and talked
      to each other about such entertaining things. RANK. I see—it is their
      place I have taken. NORA. _[jumping up and going to him]_. Oh, dear, nice
      Doctor Rank, I never meant that at all. But surely you can understand that
      being with Torvald is a little like being with papa—_[Enter MAID from the
      hall.]_ MAID. If you please, ma’am. _[Whispers and hands her a card.]_
      NORA. _[glancing at the card]_. Oh! _[Puts it in her pocket.]_ RANK. Is
      there anything wrong? NORA. No, no, not in the least. It is only
      something—it is my new dress— RANK. What? Your dress is lying there. NORA.
      Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald mustn’t know
      about it— RANK. Oho! Then that was the great secret. NORA. Of course. Just
      go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room. Keep him as long as— RANK.
      Make your mind easy; I won’t let him escape. _[Goes into HELMER’S room.]_
      NORA. _[to the MAID]_. And he is standing waiting in the kitchen? MAID.
      Yes; he came up the back stairs. NORA. But didn’t you tell him no one was
      in? MAID. Yes, but it was no good. NORA. He won’t go away? MAID. No; he
      says he won’t until he has seen you, ma’am. NORA. Well, let him come
      in—but quietly. Helen, you mustn’t say anything about it to anyone. It is
      a surprise for my husband. MAID. Yes, ma’am, I quite understand. _[Exit.]_
      NORA. This dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of
      me! No, no, no, it can’t happen—it shan’t happen! _[She bolts the door of
      HELMER’S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it
      after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.]_ NORA.
      _[advancing towards him]_. Speak low—my husband is at home. KROGSTAD. No
      matter about that. NORA. What do you want of me? KROGSTAD. An explanation
      of something. NORA. Make haste then. What is it? KROGSTAD. You know, I
      suppose, that I have got my dismissal. NORA. I couldn’t prevent it, Mr.
      Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could on your side, but it was no good.
      KROGSTAD. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I can
      expose you to, and yet he ventures— NORA. How can you suppose that he has
      any knowledge of the sort? KROGSTAD. I didn’t suppose so at all. It would
      not be the least like our dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage—
