    <h3>A Doll's House --<i>Author: Henrik Ibsen</i></h3>
    <p>
      NORA. _[drops her cloak]_. Someone is coming now! _[Goes to the door and
      listens.]_ No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas
      Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—_[opens the door and looks out]_.
      No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes forward.]_ What
      rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldn’t
      happen; it is impossible—I have three little children. _[Enter the NURSE
      from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard box.]_
    </p>
    <p>NURSE. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>
    <p>NORA. Thanks; put it on the table.</p>
    <p>NURSE. _[doing so]_. But it is very much in want of mending.</p>
    <p>NORA. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>
    <p>
      NURSE. What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
    </p>
    <p>NORA. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>
    <p>
      NURSE. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
      ma'am, and make yourself ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA. _[begins to unpack the box, but soon pushes it away from her]_. If
      only I dared go out. If only no one would come. If only I could be sure
      nothing would happen here in the meantime. Stuff and nonsense! No one will
      come. Only I mustn’t think about it. I will brush my muff. What lovely,
      lovely gloves! Out of my thoughts, out of my thoughts! One, two, three,
      four, five, six— _[Screams.]_ Ah! there is someone coming—. _[Makes a
      movement towards the door, but stands irresolute.]_
      <br />
      _[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and
      hat.]_
      <br />
      NORA. Oh, it’s you, Christine. There is no one else out there, is there?
      How good of you to come!
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you
      could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow
      evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs’, who live
      above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and
      dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
      <br />
      MRS LINDE. I see; you are going to keep up the character
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA. Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it
      made for me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven’t any idea—
      <br />
      MRS LINDE. We will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming
      come unsewn here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that’s all we
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      NORA. It is nice of you.
      <br />
      MRS LINDE. _[sewing]_. So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I
      will tell you what—I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine
      feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful
      evening yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS LINDE. And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father’s
      daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as
      he was yesterday?
      <br />
      NORA. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he
      suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine,
      poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of
      excesses; and that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you
      understand?
