    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>_[drops her cloak]_.</p>
    <p>
       Someone is coming now!  No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas
      Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—</p>
      <p>_[opens the door and looks out]_</p>. <p>No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty.</p>
       <p>_[Comes forward.]_</p> <p>What
        rubbish! of course he can't be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldnt
        happen; it is impossible—I have three little children.</p> <p>_[Enter the NURSE
          from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard box.]_</p> 
    </p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>Thanks; put it on the table.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p> _[doing so]_.</p> 
    <p> But it is very much in want of mending.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>
      What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma'am, and
      make yourself ill.
    </p>
    <p>_[Enter Mrs Linde from the hall, where she has taken off her cloak and
      hat.]_</p>
    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could help
      me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening
      there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborg's, who live above us;
      and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the
      Tarantella that I learned at Capri.
    </p>
    <h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p>I see; you are going to keep up the character</p>
    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, Torvald wants me to. Look, here is the dress; Torvald had it made for
      me there, but now it is all so torn, and I haven't any idea—
    </p>
    <h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p>
      We will easily put that right. It is only some of the trimming come unsewn
      here and there. Needle and thread? Now then, that's all we want.
    </p>
    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>It is nice of you.</p>
    <h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p>_[sewing]_.</p>
    <p>
       So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell
      you what—I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers.
      But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <h4>MRS LINDE.</h4>
    <p>
      And so do you, it seems to me; you are not your father's daughter for
      nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as he was
      yesterday?
    </p>
    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>
      No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he suffers from
      a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine, poor creature.
      His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses; and
      that is why his son was sickly from childhood, do you understand?
