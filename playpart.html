      NORA. _[drops her cloak]_. Someone is coming now! _[Goes to the door and
      listens.]_ No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today, Christmas
      Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—_[opens the door and looks out]_.
      No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes forward.]_ What
      rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it. Such a thing couldn’t
      happen; it is impossible—I have three little children. _[Enter the NURSE
      from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard box.]_
    </p>
    <p>NURSE. At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>
    <p>NORA. Thanks; put it on the table.</p>
    <p>NURSE. _[doing so]_. But it is very much in want of mending.</p>
    <p>NORA. I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>
    <p>
      NURSE. What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
    </p>
    <p>NORA. Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>
    <p>
      NURSE. What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold,
      ma’am, and make yourself ill.
